-- Step 1: Create the Customer and Account tables
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    C_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    cname VARCHAR(50),
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Account (
    Acc_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    C_id INT,
    Acc_Type VARCHAR(50),
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (C_id) REFERENCES Customer(C_id)
);

-- Step 2: Insert sample data
INSERT INTO Customer (C_id, cname, city) VALUES 
(1, 'Rahul', 'Mumbai'),
(2, 'Pooja', 'Pune'),
(3, 'Amit', 'Mumbai'),
(4, 'Neha', 'Pune');

INSERT INTO Account (Acc_id, C_id, Acc_Type, amount) VALUES
(101, 1, 'saving', 5000.00),
(102, 2, 'current', 7000.00),
(103, 3, 'saving', 8000.00),
(104, 4, 'current', 3000.00);

-- Query 1: Show cname, Acc_Type, and amount of customers with a saving account
SELECT Customer.cname, Account.Acc_Type, Account.amount
FROM Customer
JOIN Account ON Customer.C_id = Account.C_id
WHERE Account.Acc_Type = 'saving';

-- Query 2: Display data using Natural, Left, and Right Joins

-- Natural Join
SELECT * 
FROM Customer 
NATURAL JOIN Account;

-- Left Join
SELECT Customer.cname, Account.Acc_Type, Account.amount
FROM Customer 
LEFT JOIN Account ON Customer.C_id = Account.C_id;

-- Right Join
SELECT Customer.cname, Account.Acc_Type, Account.amount
FROM Customer 
RIGHT JOIN Account ON Customer.C_id = Account.C_id;

-- Query 3: Display information of customers living in the same city as ‘Pooja’
SELECT * 
FROM Customer 
WHERE city = (SELECT city FROM Customer WHERE cname = 'Pooja');

-- Query 4: Display account information with less amount than average bank amount
SELECT * 
FROM Account 
WHERE amount < (SELECT AVG(amount) FROM Account);

-- Query 5: Display C_id with maximum amount in account
SELECT C_id 
FROM Account 
WHERE amount = (SELECT MAX(amount) FROM Account);

-- Query 6: Display amount and Acc_Type of customers with the minimum amount for each Acc_Type
SELECT Acc_Type, amount 
FROM Account 
WHERE (Acc_Type, amount) IN (
    SELECT Acc_Type, MIN(amount)
    FROM Account
    GROUP BY Acc_Type
);

-- Query 7: Display amount of accounts with amount higher than any saving account amount
SELECT amount 
FROM Account 
WHERE amount > ANY (SELECT amount FROM Account WHERE Acc_Type = 'saving');
